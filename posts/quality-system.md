description: 'In the last fifty years the city of Oslo has slowly begun to neglect the value of aestethics in architecture and city planning. There are very few parts of the law that regulate what materials are used and how they are used - which has a negative imapact on the people that live in the city. The latest city planning project in Oslo is the new district of Flipstad.  To create a new perspective on how we should approach aesthetics in city planning thirty students took on the challange to convince the politicians and have the voice of the youth heard in the public space.'
